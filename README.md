We will keep updating the repository, making it easier to reproduce.

### For a quick try
You can generate some synthetic data by MultiLoad-GAN or SingleLoad-GAN. We have the trained model in this repository. 

If you would like to try the synthetic generation method quickly, all you need to do is to run _evaluation.py_. Then you will get the generated data in dataset folder.

### Process dataset
In dataset folder, _GANData0.csv_ and _classiferSorted0.csv_ are the real data for training. Other files are the generated load data.
If you want to prepare the training data (recreate _GANData0.csv_) by yourself, _run newRiver.py_. In case you may not have access to the original full dataset, you can not run this part.

### Retrain MultiLoad-GAN
We have included the trained model in checkpoints. 
If you want to retrain MultiLoad-GAN, run _groupGAN.py_.
If you want to retrain the Automatic Data Augmentation process, run _train_model.py_.

### Retrain SingleLoad-GAN
We have included the trained model in SingleLoadGAN/checkpoints. 
If you want to retrain SingleLoad-GAN, run SingleLoad-GAN/singleUser_Train.py

### Retrain classifier
We have included the trained model in classifier/model. 
run classifier/classifier.py

### Show evaluation results
In _evaluation.py_, run the _eval()_ function.
